For those interested in GIS and spatial analysis, here are two tutorials to download data from [OpenStreet Maps (OSM)](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog585/node/738) into R.

OSM is an open platform storing georeferenced data. The data in OSM is produced and managed by the people, and is freely available for visualization, query, download, and modification. OMS is especially useful for data at the city level.

The first tutorial *Getting Spatial Data*, shows different ways to access data from OSM. The second one, *Managing Spatial data in R*, shows how to manage the data in R.
