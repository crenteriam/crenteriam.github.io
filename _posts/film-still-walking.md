Plot Here.
-the worst of the imaginable tragedies: the death of child.

Inability to overcome mourning.
- long-term mourning
- inability to scape dolor y mourning. Inability to accept the tragic sense of life, never found consolation on tragedy
- trapped in anger dad, and trapped in confusion, depression and revenge/blame mom
- both overlooking and underestimating taking care of those beloved ones who are still Walking
- as the movie goes, the characters did not find the way to accept the tragic sense of exterior world, and embrace reconciliation with the past, with other (other professions),

The second best.
- Ryo not doing well in job
- second best in family, and married with a widow
- stepfather, second father
- never being up to expectations

Still Walking.
- a family (parents) that did not find the way to accept the tragic sense of life, as others may have.
- meanwhile those who are still walking take care of each other (cite the women)
- fighting each other until the very last day... helplessly never reconciliated with tragedy.
