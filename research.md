Is remarkable how some technological innovations have impacted people's lifestyles and behaviors, organizational practices, and social dynamics. The Web 2.0, distributed computing, and artifical intelligence,[^1] for example, have transformed the production, storage, processing and transmission of information.

I find joy understanding the implications of *information technologies in organizations*; how, for example, they transform citizen participation, managerial practices in workplaces, decision-making practices or *how* (and *how good*) public services are being delivered.

Thinking of information technologies as instruments for change, I do research seeking to address three contemporary challenges of public administration:

- Improving citizen participation and governance mechanisms
- Improving the quality of decision-making in government
- Stengthening democratic values in public institutions

Seeking answers for these challenges, I analyze the interactions between social and technological change, social mobilization, and citizen participation; I explore the evolution of bureaucracies in the XXI century; and I study the causes and consequences of the declining trust in government.
