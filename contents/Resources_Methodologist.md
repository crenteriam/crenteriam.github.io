In this page, I collected resources for scholars in publica administration looking to strenghten their methodological tools for research. Several disciplinary fields related with public administration (political science, psichology, organizational theory, economics) have journals specialized in methodology. Although public administration scholarship does not have any, journals in the field regularly feature methodological articles.

I don't believe a dedicated methods journal is necessary, as many overlaping disciplinary fields have regular top quality publications  and they are equally relevant to public administration scholarship. Here is a list of journals specialized in methodology relevant to public administration, by discipline.

- Political Science:
-- [Political Science Research and Methods](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods)
-- [Political Methodology](https://www.jstor.org/journal/polimethod)
-- [Political Analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis)
-- [The Political Methodologist](https://thepoliticalmethodologist.com/)
-- [Political Science Research and Methods](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods)
- Psichology:
-- [Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Sciences](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/AMP)
- Organizational studies:
-- [Organizational Research Methods](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/orm)
- Sociology:

## Other resources

Besides these soureces, I highly recommend following up Andrew Gelman's blog [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/), *Nature*'s series [Points of Significance](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) Kristin Sainani [Statistically Speaking](https://web.stanford.edu/~kcobb/writing.html) editorial series, [Douglas G. Altman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_QnLm3kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) [Statistics notes](https://www.bmj.com/specialties/statistics-notes) series, [Herman Aguinis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbMNUXoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) articles, and Gary King's [website](https://gking.harvard.edu/). I have found all these amazing resources for learning about statistics.

Finally, this is a short list of journals outside Public Administration that publish lots of innovative and high quality empirical research. They are a great source to keep fresh our thinking about empirical studies.
