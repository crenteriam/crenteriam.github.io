### Troubleshooting Latex

Troubleshooting is one of the most time-consuming parts of learning compiling dynamic documents, specially in Latex. The best way to (avoid and) solve troubles is by using text editors. As explained in [Chapter X](), the Do-File Editor is very limited compared to others, and it is specially unhelpful for troubleshooting.

The best troubleshooting alternatives are Overleaf, TexStudio. These are specialized text editors in Latex and will provide you the line with the problem and a concrete explanation. They also will automatically flag elementary problems, such as a closing `}` missing or things like that.

Other ways to avoid troubleshooting in both Stata and Latex, is by writing your Do-Files from third party text editors. Recommended Atom and Sublime Texts. Old-School, highly robust alternatives are Vim and Emacs.
