Notes for Teaching Stata/Latex POS 517

Staging the requirements:

### Beginner
A very, very basic document.
- No Latex packages required
- No formatting options used
- Include title and section commands.
- Introduce to the Latex operators (e.g. _, &, %) and the escape (\).
- Strategies to troubleshoot (we could either give some ideas, and also ask the current students for feedback on how to troubleshoot efficiently).
- Maybe this stage for two assignments?
- By 4B all students fully adapted to the current version of the Template.

### Intermediate
- Introduce the most used packages (see below) and commands (e.g. bigskip)
- Introduce formatting (e.g. geometry, hyperref, etc., options in the article class like fontsize, paper type)
- Introduce itemize, italics, bold, and Math.
- Managing Tables and Figures.

### Advanced
- Introduce other classess (e.g. journal classes -acmart, elsart, beamer, book).
- Beautiful tables with estout
- Idea: collaboration in Sharelatex.
- Introdue macros (global, local, scalar). Use them for y, x, controls.
- Rnw
