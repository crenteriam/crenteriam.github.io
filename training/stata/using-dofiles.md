### Do-Files {#DoFiles}

A **Do-File** is a text file (like the Notepad's .txt files) that contains commands or functions written by the user. Using the do-file serves many purposes, most importantly reproducibility of your work. Once you write command lines in the do-file, you can run them in the Stata's console by clicking Run. This process is the equivalent to typing commands in the Command Window, but all your work keeps stored. The Do-File works on a stand-alone window named Do-File Editor, which is a simple text editor. Alongside the datasets, the Do-File is the most important file you will manage in Stata. Programming within the Do-File Editor should become second nature to you by the end of this course. Thus, for this class, you MUST ALWAYS program and store your work in Do-Files. If you are not familiar with computer science, do not feel afraid by the word programming. By using Stata, you are programming, and by the end of this course, you are expected to become a good programmer. It's part of statistics practice nowadays. Watch the mini-lecture Stata Do-file Editor Intro. Review the section 16 Do-Files. Then, revise the examples here and here.

### Log Files {#LogFiles}

A Log File is a file that stores everything that is displayed in the Results Window. This is, every command you have typed through the Command Window or you have run from a Do-File, and their corresponding results. The file extension is .smcl (which stands for Stata Markup and Control Language) and can only be open in Stata. You are not expected to use or store log files for the course. Probably the best use you can make out of it is in the production of dynamic documents and reproducible research. Watch the mini-lectures Keeping Track of your Stata Session and Logs and .do Files. Review the section 11 Saving and Printing Output. Then, revise the example here.
Commenting in the Do-File. Everything that is green in your Do-File is a comment. Comments are very useful for documenting what you are doing, remind yourself what a command you’ve recently learn does, etc. Always comment extensively your Do-Files. Document your thoughts by making your comments clear and thoughtful. Watch the mini-lecture Do Files & Log Files. Then, revise the examples here and here.

<u>Practice</u>

- Go over Matthew Ingram’s Introduction to Stata files, download the Data Management in Stata Do-File and Data Analysis in Stata Do-File. Try to reproduce the analysis in your computer using these Do-Files. Read carefully his comments in the Do-File.
