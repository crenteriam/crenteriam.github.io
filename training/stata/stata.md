This handout aims to serve as an introduction to Stata for students that have not had used Stata before. The handout contains three parts: 1) a series of short mini-lecture videos (5-6 minutes each); 2) extended lecture plus examples from Dr. Weinberg’s PAD 688 lectures (if there is no 688 video, you will see examples from the web); and 3) some exercise. The handout is split into two modules: 1) Introducing the software, and 2) Using Do-Files. Your task is to first watch the mini-lecture videos, then review the examples provided, and finally practice. Feel free to skip the parts you are already familiar with the topic, but don’t miss the mini-lectures. Even if you know the topic, the videos would help you as a refresher and a heads up of what is coming in the course. Next, practice the materials with the exercises provided (practicing is the most important part). If you feel you need more help, you can contact Cesar, the Teaching Assistant. You can also use some other resources you found useful. At the end of this Handout, there are some additional resources that you might find useful.

The University has currently installed Stata Version 15 in all its computers. You can access Stata in the Library or any Campus Lab. Many students might be working in a previous version, though. Thus, we are going to make sure that every exercise or assignment can be run on Stata Version 13.

### Further Resources

Other great sources for help are the [Stata’s Documentation](https://www.stata.com/features/documentation/). One of the best references for this course is [Stata User’s Guide](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/users-guide/). All you need to know for getting started with Stata is in [Getting Started with Stata for Windows](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/getting-started-windows/) and [Getting Started with Stata for Mac](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/getting-started-mac/). All topics reviewed here are covered in that guide. Also, check out these [cheat sheets](http://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/portfolio/01_resource/). It will be very useful to have them close when doing the assignments.
