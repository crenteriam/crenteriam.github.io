### Folders

- Root directory and sub-folders
- hierarchical organization
- some people would prefer to first numer their folders so they appear in kind of a chronological order.

Working Directory. All your work should be self-contained in a working directory. You should not need files outside the working directory. A WD is a parent directory with subdirectories organized by function:
Data
Do-Files
Figures
Tables

### Organization

Keep original data intact. Never overwrite, instead create a new processed dataset.
Relative Paths. Makes your code less dependent to a particular computer (thus can be easily run by your advisor, colleague, etc.)

```

### Version Control

Version control. System that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Separate Jobs

- separate processes: each do-file a process
- three processes: data managing, data analysis, reporting.

data_management.do / data_preparation.do
Actions: import, clean, polish.

data_analysis.do
Actions: create graphs, descriptive statistics, regressions, etc.

reporting.do (later in the semester)
Neat and clean report based on LaTeX
Function: save your time by integrating the reporting final document, instead of copying and pasting to Word every time you modify something.
Tables and Figures look more nice and professional.

### File Namig

The name of the file must tell the reader clear hints about the contents
Descriptive is better than short

Good practice:
Identifier of the process (e.g. data_management, report_conference, etc.)
Date (with consistent formant, e.g. YYYYMMDD)
State of file (e.g. temp, test, review, final, etc.)
In colaborations, initials of the author (i.e. MI, CR).
