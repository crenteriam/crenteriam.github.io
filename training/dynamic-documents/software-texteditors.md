### What is a Text Editor?

### Why does it Matter?

### Do-File Editor (text editor)

- dofile is a text Editor

### Comparing Do-File Editor with others


[text editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors)

A Text Editor is a software that produces some output by just typing plain text. For example, the Do-File processes data and makes calculations thorugh an, essentially, data filled with plain text. For Windows users, the classic example of a text editor is Microsoft notepad. That is a great example of plain text.

Text Editors contrast with rich text applications, such as word processors. In rich text applications, like Word, you can format and edit the text you are typing.

Latex, Markdown, and HTML are markup languages that will enrich the text visually represented in documents.

- text editors vs word processors

Computing programmers develop software in text processors. Although most of the text editors are targeted for a software developing audience, the spread of programming statistics have seen the integration of statistics programming languages incorporated into the capabilities of text editors.

Two great text editors for working with Stata are Sublime Text and Atom. Atom it's build by the team at Github, and has nice featueres, not only for statistical programming and text processing, but also for collaboration and version control. Of course, there are the two classic text editors Emacs and Vim. Rstudio have developed its IDE into a text processing software, leveraging markdown for the .rmd file extension.

Overleaf deserves a worthy note...

Features of a good Text Editor (for use in statistical programming and text processing:)
- It's open source software. Not only the advantage of being *gratis*, and having your files usable across any platform and computer, but also because the community of users produce very useful add-ons.
- It is supported across several platforms (Windows, Mac or Linux)
- Supports several programming languages.
- Programming syntax highlighters.
- Autocompletion of programming code
- Troubleshooting tools
- Interactive inline documentation

Disadvantages of Do-File Editor as text editor:
- It only supports Stata syntax highlights.
- It does not provide autocompletion of programming code
- No Troubleshooting tools
- Licensed software.
