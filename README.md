This is a **draft** personal website for academic communication. The website address is https://crenteriam.github.io/

The Website is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). I also adapted some HTML code from [Vitaly Repin's blog](https://github.com/vitalyrepin/vrepinblog). Other exemplary Lanyon themes are [Bradley Boehmke's website](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/), [Paul Len's Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/menu/about.html), and [UC R Github](https://github.com/uc-r/uc-r.github.io).

Other materials for an academic website: [Academicpages Template](https://academicpages.github.io/)
