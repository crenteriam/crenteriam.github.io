This is a personal website for academic communication. The Website is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). I also adapted some HTML code from [Vitaly Repin's blog](https://github.com/vitalyrepin/vrepinblog). Other exemplary Lanon themes are [Bradley Boehmke's website](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/) and [UC R Github](https://github.com/uc-r/uc-r.github.io).

Other materials for an academic website: [Academicpage Template](https://academicpages.github.io/).
